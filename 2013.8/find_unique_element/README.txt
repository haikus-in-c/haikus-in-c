Problem: Actuaally very simple - find the number of unique elements in a set
The code currently finds the number of unique elements in an array of integers, but the principles and ideas apply for any data type and collection data structure. 

Solution: 
find_unique.c - contains the code to compute the solution and a set of tests in main(). 

ds.h - a set of data structure implementations for the following: 
Binary Search Trees
Red-Black Trees 
(Hypothetical) Fixed-Size BST - ends up using too much memory
Skip Lists 

Contains methods for inserting, searching, printing to console, and memory cleanup. 
Doesn't contain any methods for single element deletion.
